      <div class="docs_section_title_1">Introduction</div>
      <div class="docs_section_1">
         Bitmarkets is a free and open source protocol and example client for a decentralized marketplace which uses <a href="http://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> as it's currency and <a href="http://bitmessage.org/">Bitmessage</a> as it's communications transport protocol. Mutual security deposits between buyer and seller on individual transactions are used ensure incentives are aligned for completing the transaction without the need for either reputation systems or trusted 3rd parties.
         <br><br>
         This document is a non-technical overview of how the Bitmarkets client and protocol work. For a more technical details, see the <a href="http://voluntary.net/bitmarkets/protocol_specification.html">Bitmarkets protocol specification</a>.

      <div class="docs_section_title_1">Motivation</div>
      <div class="docs_section_1">
         <!--
            In the past, market transactions were done with anonymous payment systems such as coins and paper cash and could be done without recording the transaction history of the buyer.
            -->
         The current state of commerce is one of centralized marketplaces and payment services that extract high fees, impose and abuse excessive control and remove any hope of privacy from users.
         <!--
            The use of anonymous payment systems such as coins and paper cash is disappearing as an option for many products.
            -->
         As more commerce moves online many consumers may find their lifetime history of purchases (including books, personal items and location details) for sale to advertisers, employers, stalkers, curious neighbors, political opponents and government agencies. 
         <br><br>
         An ideal system would be one of secure private transactions directly between producers and consumers without middle men collecting data or adding fees. Such systems are now feasible by combining recently developed technologies for anonymous decentralized payments and anonymous decentralized messaging.

      <div class="docs_section_title_2">Client</div>
      <div class="docs_section_1">
         To use the marketplace, a client application which implements the Bitmarkets protocol is needed. The client is used to post, browse and execute transactions and contains a bitcoin wallet which is used to construct the multi-signature two-party escrow transactions used for security deposits, payments and refunds. 
      </div>
      <div class="docs_section_title_2">Identities</div>
      <div class="docs_section_1">
         The client uses the Bitmessage anonymous decentralized messaging network and Tor (a source location hiding communications network)  to broadcast sales and exchange transaction related messages. Upon starting the client, a Bitmessage identity (a public encryption key) is generated which, like an email address, will be used for communications on the network. 
      </div>
 
      <div class="docs_section_title_2">Depositing Funds</div>
      <div class="docs_section_1">
      In order to complete a transaction, both buyer and seller must have sufficient funds in their wallets for escrow and payment. The client contains a Bitcoin wallet in which these funds can be deposited and withdrawn.
      </div>
           
      <div class="docs_section_title_2">Posting Sales</div>
      <div class="docs_section_1">
         Using the client, a seller specifies the region, category, title, description and price and broadcasts this to a specific Bitmessage channel. These posts are then relayed throughout the Bitmessage network where other clients see them and make them browsable by buyers.
      </div>
      
      <div class="docs_section_title_2">Requesting a Purchase</div>
      <div class="docs_section_1">
         Using the client, buyers can browse regions and categories to find products/services for sale. If/when they choose an item to buy, the client sends a Bitmessage to the requesting a purchase.

      <div class="docs_section_1">

<div class="docs_section_title_2">Choice of Escrow Ratios</div>
      <div class="docs_section_1">
      The purpose of escrow is to ensure both parties have sufficiently strong incentives to complete transactions. The approach of this analysis is to look at critical limits in order to extrapolate a conservative range of escrow ratios that ensure a functioning market.
      <!--
       For simplicity, it's assumed a functioning market is one where consistently malicious actors will on average go bankrupt assuming their bankroll is small compared to the volume of the market.

  </div>
  
       <div class="docs_section_title_2">Simplifying Assumptions</div>
      <div class="docs_section_1">
It's assumed a functioning market is one where consistently malicious actors will on average go bankrupt assuming their bankroll is small compared to the volume of the market. It's also assumed this is an efficient market where margins are low so seller profit margins are small enough to ignore (i.e. for our conservative escrow estimates to cover). 
      </div>  
      
      <div class="docs_section_title_2">No Deposits</div>
      <div class="docs_section_1">
      With no deposits, an anonymous buyer has no direct economic incentive to complete the payment on delivery of the purchased item and even a single malicious buyer could bring down the entire market by ordering all items and not paying for any of them. Likewise, a single malicious seller might burry the market with fake sales which are never delivered. So our deposit must be greater than zero for a market to reliably function in the absence of a reputation system or trusted 3rd party escrow.
      </div>  
      
      <div class="docs_section_title_2">High Deposits</div>
      <div class="docs_section_1">
      The larger the ratio of mutual security deposit to payment, the greater incentive each side has to faithfully complete the transaction until the value becomes so large that one or both sides find in too costly to withhold escrow release to punish the other side for not completing the transaction and may accept being defrauded in order to minimize their losses.

      <div class="docs_section_title_2">High Deposits</div>
      <div class="docs_section_1"> 
          -->
          
      The picture so far is that possible losses on both side should be above zero but not above the amount either party is willing to loose in order to satisfy punitive motivations.

      There is a spectrum of fraud situations but for simplicity (and because the client only offers full refunds or payments as options) only the following two will be considered for now and discuss the issue of the quality of the item delivered later.

      <br><br>
      For the first version of the Bitmarkets client we choose to use a 1-1 ratio as item cost to per-party security deposit. That is, for a item costing X, the escrow transaction locks 2X (1X for deposit and 1X for payment) from the buyer and 1X from the seller - a total of 3X.

         <div class="docs_section_title_1">Escrow Lock</div>
         If the seller accepts a purchase request, buyer and seller together construct a bitcoin escrow lock transaction where each adds a security deposit and the buyer adds the payment amount. This transaction is constructed such that the funds are unspendable by both parties until both sign another transaction to release the funds.

             Sent from buyer to seller. 
             Contains the the multi-signature transaction including the buyer's inputs and signature.
             When the seller receives this message, they add their signature to the transaction and broadcast it to the bitcoin network.<br>
             
         <div class="docs_section_title_1">Delivery</div>
         After the buyer's client sees that the lock escrow transaction is confirmed in the bitcoin blockchain, they are prompted to send the seller their delivery details.
         
         <div class="docs_section_title_1">Payment</div>
         After the seller provides the good or service to the buyer, the buyer constructs an escrow release transaction which sends the security deposits back to their respective parties and sends the payment to the seller. The seller can then sign this transaction and broadcast it to the bitcoin network to accept payment.
         <br>
         
             <div class="docs_section_title_2">SellAcceptPaymentEscrowMsg</div>

         <div class="docs_section_title_1">Refund</div>
         If the good or service is not provided, the seller can construct a refund request which returns the security deposits to their respective parties and returns the payment to the buyer. If the seller chooses, they can then sign this transaction and broadcast it to the bitcoin network to refund the payment.
