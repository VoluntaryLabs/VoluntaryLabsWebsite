<div class=faq_question style="text-align:left; margin-top:0px; padding-top:0px;">
How is Bitmarkets different from other decentralized markets?
</div>
<div>
The main difference is how escrow is handled. 
<br><br>
Bitmarkets uses two party escrow directly between buyer and seller with no third parties. In our system the buyer locks 2x the price of the item and seller locks 1x the price of the item into a transaction and both have to agree how to unlock for payment or refund. This ensures both parties have an economic incentive to complete the transaction without the need for a trusted 3rd party.
<br><br>
OpenBazaar uses a trusted 3rd-party escrow system. Third parties have no way to fairly resolve a dispute as they only have one person's word verses another. A shipment receipt can confirm that an item of a given weight was shipped to a particular address but not, for example, whether the item a working xbox or a bag of sand.

<div class=faq_question>
What's the monetization model?
</div>
<div>
There is none. It's a marketplace with no middle men, including us. 
</div>

<div class=faq_question>
Who is behind it and how much work has gone into this?
</div>
<div>
Four people working in their free time since the beginning of 2014:
<br><br>
Chris Robinson: UI design<br>
Rich Collins: Bitcoin integration<br>
Adam Thorson: Bitmessage and Tor integration<br>
Steve Dekorte: lead & UI implementation
</div>

<div class=faq_question>
What's the history of the project? 
</div>
<div>
Inspired by <a href="https://nashx.com">NashX</a>, Steve wrote up a rough spec in 2013 for a market based on a decentralized version of it that ran on Bitmessage and Tor and got feedback from Rich, Adam, Oleg Andreev and Tom Robinson. Steve and Chris began work on Bitpost as a means of testing out a Bitmessage framework (that would later be used for Bitmarkets) and were joined by Adam to help complete Bitpost and then by Rich to help create Bitmarkets. The first working version was demoed at the <a href="https://bitcoin2014.com">Bitcoin 2014 conference</a> in May and the public beta was released on Nov 19th 2014. 
</div>

<div class=faq_question>
What's the roadmap for Bitmarkets?
</div>
<div>
User feedback integration, lots of testing, a multi-platform version. Most of the code is in Bitmessage and BitcoinJ, which is already portable.
</div>

<div class=faq_question>
Can I help?
</div>
<div>
Yes! Please connect with us via <a href="mailto:us@voluntary.net">us@voluntary.net</a>. Testing, working on a possible GNUstep port, marketing, and making tutorial and intro videos would be particularly helpful.
